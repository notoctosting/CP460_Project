# Secure Multi-Party Computation for Privacy-Preserving Financial Metrics

## Overview
This project implements Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) for calculating key financial metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR), Sharpe Ratio, and Maximum Drawdown while preserving the privacy of each participating partyâ€™s data. Optionally, it includes Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) for verifiability.
