# Secure Multi-Party Computation for Privacy-Preserving Financial Metrics

## Overview
This project implements Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) for calculating key financial metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR), Sharpe Ratio, and Maximum Drawdown while preserving the privacy of each participating partyâ€™s data. Optionally, it includes Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) for verifiability.

## Installation
To set up the environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv mpc_env
source mpc_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the example notebook examples/example_run.ipynb to see the complete workflow or use the scripts as follows:

1. Load sample data with data_loader.py.
2. Use mpc_protocol.py to initialize and execute the MPC.
3. Compute financial metrics with financial_metrics.py.
4. Run tests in tests/ to validate functionality.
