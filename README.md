# **Secure Multi-Party Computation Framework for Financial Metrics**

## **Project Overview**
This project implements a privacy-preserving framework for computing key financial metrics collaboratively across multiple parties without exposing sensitive data. Using Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Shamir's Secret Sharing, the framework demonstrates how institutions can compute metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES), Sharpe Ratio, and Portfolio Beta while maintaining data confidentiality.

The implementation is carried out in Python using the MPyC (Multiparty Computation in Python) library, focusing on accuracy, scalability, and practical usability in financial applications.

---

## **Features**
- **Secure Financial Metric Computations**:
  - Value at Risk (VaR)
  - Expected Shortfall (ES)
  - Sharpe Ratio
  - Portfolio Beta
- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques**:
  - Shamir’s Secret Sharing for secure data distribution.
  - MPC protocols for collaborative computations without data leakage.
- **Scalability Testing**:
  - Validation and performance evaluation across varying dataset sizes (100, 1000, 5000, 10,000 entries).
- **Simulation of Financial Data**:
  - Generates synthetic datasets mimicking portfolio returns to simulate real-world financial environments.

---

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.8 or later
- Required Python libraries:
  - `mpyc`: For implementing MPC protocols.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib`: For visualizing performance results.
  - `random`: For dataset generation.
  - `time`: For performance evaluation.

Install required libraries using `pip`:

```
pip install mpyc numpy matplotlib
```

## **Project Structure**

- **scripts/**
  - `mpc_protocol.py`: Implements core MPC functionalities, including Shamir’s Secret Sharing and secure operations (e.g., sum, average, variance).
  - `financial_metrics.py`: Computes financial metrics (VaR, ES, Sharpe Ratio, Portfolio Beta) using MPC protocols.
  - `performance_testing.py`: Evaluates the framework’s accuracy and scalability by comparing secure and plaintext computations.
  - `data_loader.py`: Handles data generation and input for testing.
  
- **data/**
  - Placeholder directory for datasets if real-world data is used.

---

## **Usage**

1. **Setup**:
   - Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
   - Ensure all required libraries are installed.

2. **Run Performance Testing**:
   - Execute `performance_testing.py` to validate the framework's accuracy and measure its performance for different dataset sizes.

3. **Output**:
   - The performance results (execution times and accuracy comparisons) will be displayed in the console.
   - A performance graph will be generated to illustrate scaling trends.

4. **Sample Outputs**:
   - Validation results show minimal deviation between secure and plaintext computations.
   - The log-scale performance graph demonstrates execution time growth for secure computations with increasing dataset sizes.

---

## **Customization**
- **Modify Dataset Sizes**:
   In `performance_testing.py`, you can adjust the dataset sizes in the `dataset_sizes` array to test different scales:
   ```
   dataset_sizes = [100, 1000, 5000, 10000]
   ```
- **Use Real-World Data**:
   Replace synthetic data generation in `data_loader.py` with actual financial datasets for practical validation.

---

## **Known Limitations**
- Computational overhead of MPC increases exponentially with dataset size. This is a trade-off for ensuring data privacy and security.
- Currently tested only on simulated data; real-world datasets may introduce additional challenges.

---

## **Future Improvements**
- Parallelize secure operations to improve performance for large datasets.
- Explore alternative MPC protocols for potential efficiency gains.
- Extend the framework to support additional financial metrics and scenarios.
